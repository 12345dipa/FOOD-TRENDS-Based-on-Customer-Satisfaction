# FOOD-TRENDS-Based-on-Customer-Satisfaction
During my internship, I developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to analyze customer personas, demographics, and satisfaction trends.
I created custom DAX formulas such as the Age Group calculation to categorize customers and enhance the depth of insights.
The dashboards helped identify key patterns — for example, most customers were At-Risk or Casual, with the Adult and Middle-Aged segments being the most active.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data visualization, DAX scripting, and business analytics.
I learned how to convert raw data into meaningful insights and present them effectively through visual storytelling.
Overall, this experience improved my technical, analytical, and presentation skills, helping me understand how data supports real-world decesion making.
